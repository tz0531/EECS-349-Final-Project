{"name":"Hackjack","tagline":"Teaching a Machine Blackjack Strategies Through Q-Learning","body":"### Introduction\r\nBlackjack is a popular casino game that is played all over the world, and many have come up with strategies to try to beat the dealer, such as card counting. Such exploits have been highlighted in popular culture through the movie 21, which was based off of the book Bringing Down the House, by Ben Mezrich. The game itself is highly based on probability and seems simple, but effective strategies for beating the dealer are not readily apparent without thorough probabilistic analysis. Because of this, many inexperienced players will make moves based on intuition or gut feeling without taking into account the probabilities behind their decisions. As such, the game is a good choice for applying machine learning algorithms to see whether a computer can devise an effective strategy for playing given enough trial games, so that it can beat the dealer a significant percentage of the time.  \r\n\r\n![Blackjack Game](http://www.pix123.com/freebetcodes/NewsImages/118186_free-blackjack.jpg)  \r\nFigure 1: Example of a simulated game of blackjack\r\n\r\n### Design\r\nDetail the algorithm and how the game runs, Q-values and epsilon-greedy policy\r\n\r\n### Results and Analysis\r\nAdd in graphs and comparison of our algorithm's strategy vs random and dealer's strategies\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nSum up performance of algorithm and potential future work\r\n\r\n### Contact the Authors\r\nJoonyong Rhee  \r\nAlexander Wenzel  \r\nTaylor Zheng  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
